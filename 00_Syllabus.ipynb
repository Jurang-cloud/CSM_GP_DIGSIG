    "\n",
    "**Conceptual Skills:** This senior-level undergraduate course builds on analytical skills learned in previous years by applying those skills to the analysis of 1D and 2D digital signals with an emphasis on *geophysical* applications. Major objectives of the course include:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Learning and exploiting similarities between concepts learned in calculus, differential equations, and elsewhere, and how they appear in the context of *geophysical* digital signal analysis. (ABET 1,6)\n",
    "2. Understanding how to use discrete Fourier transforms in the analysis and processing of digital signals. (ABET 1,6)\n",
    "3. Learning how to digitally sample continuous analog signals, reconstruct continuous signals from sampled ones, and the conditions under which this reconstruction is feasible. (ABET 1,6)\n",
    "4. Learning the pitfalls and tradeoffs in the design and application of common digital filters. (ABET 1,6)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Practical Skills:** To help meet these objectives students will:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Independently design, develop, validate and apply computer programs to solve *geophysical* digital signal analysis and processing tasks using the Python language and its associated tool kits (i.e., Numpy, Scipy and Matplotlib). (ABET 1,6,7)\n",
    "2. Gain experience in chosing and applying 1D/2D filters to achieve specific filtering tasks through a range of numerical exercises through independent project work and communicating your results through a technical writing exercies. (ABET 1,3,6)\n",

    "## How to get help? ##\n",
    "\n",
    "You should not hesitate to seek my help, and can do this in the following ways:\n",
    "1.\tAsk questions in class. Never hesitate to ask, even if I have explained material before. You can safely assume that if something is not clear to you, there are several classmates that have the same question. I will also answer questions related to homework.\n",
    "2.\tDrop by in my office. I travel much and am busy, but you need not hesitate to come by with questions. You can see my schedule online by visiting [here](https://sites.google.com/site/jshragge/) and clicking on “Check my schedule for availability”. I generally will not answer questions about the material covered in class by email; however, I will use it set up a meeting time.\n",

    "All students are advised to be familiar with CSM’s policy regarding the make-up of work missed due to excused absences. This policy may be found in the Bulletin.  If a student is ill and exhibits flu-like symptoms, they should not attend class, labs, or exams. In order for an absence based on illness to be excused, the student must normally communicate directly with the Associate Dean of Students or his/her instructors. In all cases of unexcused absences the faculty member has the right to deny the student the opportunity to make up all or part of the missed work. **Coursework must be turned in before it is due to be graded – plan ahead.**\n",

    "\n",
    "## Expectations for Participation ##\n",
    "\n",
    "You are expected to engage in all course activities, tasks, and assignment as an emerging professional. You are expected to spend additional time on this course each week during out-of-class time, in addition to actively participating during the lecture and lab times each week.\n",

    "## Oredigger Promise: We Climb Together ##\n",
    "\n",
    "Orediggers climb together. Orediggers look out for each other. \n",
    "It will take a shared commitment from each and every one of us to stop the spread of COVID-19, open campus and be together at Mines this year. We take great pride in being a top engineering and applied sciences university and we will strive to be the exemplar in preventing the spread of COVID-19 in a university setting.\n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore, as a member of the Oredigger community, I promise to protect classmates and colleagues, our families and neighbors, and myself by adopting the practices and attitudes summarized below; I will:\n",
    "* Complete training sessions to learn required safety practices and expectations for learning, working, and living on campus.\n",
    "* Monitor my health daily. I will report to a medical professional if I experience any of the COVID-19 symptoms: fever of 100.4F or higher, dry cough, difficulty breathing or shortness of breath, chills, unusual muscle aches, sore throat, or new loss of taste or smell.\n",
    "* Stay home if I have COVID-19-related symptoms, even if I feel well enough to come to campus.\n",
    "* Isolate and self-quarantine for the prescribed period of time after exposure to someone who is ill or has tested positive for COVID-19.\n",
    "* Maintain appropriate social distancing in all settings, both on- and off-campus.\n",
    "* Wear an appropriate face covering over my mouth and nose when indoors and in any other setting where it is difficult to maintain social distancing, and use any other protective gear prescribed by the university.\n",
    "* Wash my hands frequently using soap and water or hand sanitizer. Contribute to the cleaning of classroom surfaces as requested.\n",

    "\n",
    "Here are few do's and don'ts about communicating in your course through emails or in online discussion forums: \n",
    "* Do…\n",
    "    * Ask questions and engage in conversations as often as possible—feel free to contact the instructor via the discussion forum for questions or via email or other communication.\n",
    "    * Be patient and respectful of others and their ideas and opinions they post online.\n",
    "    * Remember to be thoughtful and use professional language. Keep in mind that things often come across differently in written text, so review your writing before posting.\n",
    "    * Be prepared for some delays in response time, as \"virtual\" communication tends to be slower than \"face-to-face\" communication.\n",
    "    * Contact the instructor if you feel that inappropriate content or behavior has occurred as part of the course. \n",
    "    * Check the syllabus and course policies stated by your instructor to know what to expect about your instructor's turnaround time for responding.\n",
    "* Do NOT…\n",
    "    * Use inappropriate language—this includes, but is not limited to, the use of curse words, swearing, or language that is derogatory.\n",
    "    * Post inappropriate materials—for example, accidentally posting/showing a picture that is not appropriate for the course content.\n",
    "    * Post in ALL CAPS, as this is perceived as shouting and avoid abbreviations and informal language (\"I'll C U L8R\").\n",
    "    * Send heated messages even if you are provoked. Likewise, if you should happen to receive a heated message, do not respond to it.\n",
    "    * Send an email or post to the entire class, unless you feel that everyone must read it.\n",

    "## Policy on academic integrity and misconduct ##  \n",
    "\n",
    "The Colorado School of Mines affirms the principle that all individuals associated with the Mines academic community have a responsibility for establishing, maintaining an fostering an understanding and appreciation for academic integrity. In broad terms, this implies protecting the environment of mutual trust within which scholarly exchange occurs, supporting the ability of the faculty to fairly and effectively evaluate every student’s academic achievements, and giving credence to the university’s educational mission, its scholarly objectives and the substance of the degrees it awards. The protection of academic integrity requires there to be clear and consistent standards, as well as confrontation and sanctions when individuals violate those standards. The Colorado School of Mines desires an environment free of any and all forms of academic misconduct and expects students to act with integrity at all times.\n",
    "\n",
    "Academic misconduct is the intentional act of fraud, in which an individual seeks to claim credit for the work and efforts of another without authorization, or uses unauthorized materials or fabricated information in any academic exercise. Student Academic Misconduct arises when a student violates the principle of academic integrity. Such behavior erodes mutual trust, distorts the fair evaluation of academic achievements, violates the ethical code of behavior upon which education and scholarship rest, and undermines the credibility of the university. Because of the serious institutional and individual ramifications, student misconduct arising from violations of academic integrity is not tolerated at Mines. If a student is found to have engaged in such misconduct sanctions such as change of a grade, loss of institutional privileges, or academic suspension or dismissal may be imposed.\n",
