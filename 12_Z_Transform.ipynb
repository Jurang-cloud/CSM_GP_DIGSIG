The Z-Transform, here written symbolically as $\\mathcal{Z}[\\cdot]$, is commonly given as the **bilateral** or **two-sided** transformation of a discrete time-series $x[n]$ into the [formal power series](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formal_power_series) $X(z)$ defined as:\n",

While the two equations are equivalent, the do result in a number of changes that I will mention these below.
