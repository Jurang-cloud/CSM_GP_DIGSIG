    "[Digital Signal Processing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_signal_processing) (or DSP) is one of the *most powerful technologies* that will shape science and engineering in the twenty-first century.

In this course we will assume that **discrete-time signal** is equivalent to a **digital signal** (equivalent to saying that the quantizer has infinite resolution).  Thus, we will commonly write continuous and discrete (and quantized) signal as $x(t)$ and $x[nT]$, where parentheses and square brackets will denote continuity and discreteness, respectively."

    "## Signals vs. Underlying Processes\n",
    "\n",
    "In most cases we aim to model geophysical phenomena using **deterministic equations** (e.g., acoustic wave equation, Maxwell's equations).  Given an known input, these equations will generate a predictable output (for a noise-less system).  However, distinguishing between the acquired **signal** and the **underlying stochastic process** is often very important.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, imagine creating a 1000 point signal by flipping a coin 1000 times. If the coin flip is heads, the corresponding sample is made a value of one. On tails, the sample is set to zero. The process that created this signal has a mean of exactly 0.5, determined by the relative probability of each possible outcome: 50% heads, 50% tails. However, it is unlikely that the actual 1000 point signal will have a mean of exactly 0.5. Random chance will make the number of ones and zeros slightly different each time the signal is generated. The probabilities of the underlying process are constant, but the statistics of the acquired signal change each time the experiment is repeated.  This random irregularity found in actual data is called by such names as:  **statistical variation**, **statistical fluctuation**, and **statistical noise**. \n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, we live in a world where even though we understand many deterministic equations and systems of equations, the data we record and use are contaminated with both **coherent and incoherent noise**.  Much of the signal processing work that you will do is trying to limit these sources of noise in order to enhance the signal.  This is one of the main reasons why it is good to study digital signal processing! "

    "* *Reliable*: processing of 0's and 1's is almost immune to noise, and data are easily stored without deterioration\n",
